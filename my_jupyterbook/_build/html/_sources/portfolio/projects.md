# Projects

## ATLAS Project
- Analyzed particle data using ATLANTIS and ROOT software, applying statistical methods and C++ programming to study electron and muon momentum distributions in high-energy particle collisions.
- Calibrated the electromagnetic calorimeter with Z (^0) boson decay data, achieving a precise energy calibration of 90.46 GeV to ensure accurate and reliable measurements in particle physics.

## Properties of Elementary Particles
- Investigated 24 GeV proton-proton reactions using detailed bubble chamber data analysis, determining total and elastic cross sections to understand the fundamental interaction dynamics.
- Identified particles produced in collisions and weak decays, using sophisticated statistical methods to estimate particle production rates and validate theoretical models in particle physics research.
