# EAS503 Project Summary

Hereâ€™s a comprehensive summary of the work done in this session:

---

### **1. Dataset and Preprocessing**
- **Database Connection**:
  - Connected to `mobile_phones.db` using SQLite.
  - Retrieved data using SQL queries with multiple table joins (`phones`, `screen_specs`, `camera_specs`, `phone_features`, and `storage_specs`).

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created new features:
    - `total_camera` = `front_camera` + `primary_camera`
    - `total_pixels` = `px_height` * `px_width`
  - Imputed missing or zero values for `sc_w` using the mean.
  - Dropped redundant features:
    - `front_camera`, `primary_camera`, `px_height`, `px_width`, `three_g`.

- **Data Normalization**:
  - Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize features like `battery_power`, `ram`, and `int_memory`.

---

### **2. Model Training**
- **Trained Models**:
  - Primarily used `XGBClassifier` for classification (`price_range` prediction).
  - Experimented with:
    - `LogisticRegression`
    - `RidgeClassifier`
    - `RandomForestClassifier`

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Used `accuracy_score` and `classification_report` to evaluate the model.
  - Achieved ~89.55% accuracy after including derived features like `total_camera` and `total_pixels`.

- **Model Saving**:
  - Saved the trained `XGBClassifier` as `xgboost_classifier_model_ultimate.pkl` using `joblib`.

- **Generated Test Cases**:
  - Randomly sampled 5 test inputs from the test set and saved them as `test_cases.json` for later use.

---

### **3. Backend Development**
- **FastAPI Backend**:
  - Developed `fas_app.py`:
    - Root endpoint (`/`): Welcome message.
    - Prediction endpoint (`/predict/`): Accepts JSON payloads via Pydantic `PhoneData` schema and returns the predicted `price_range`.

- **Validation and Error Handling**:
  - Ensured all required features (`battery_power`, `clock_speed`, etc.) are included in the request.
  - Added error handling for prediction issues.

- **Testing**:
  - Tested the backend using test cases and direct API calls.

---

### **4. Frontend Development**
- **Streamlit App**:
  - Created an interactive app for user input via sliders for features.
  - Dynamically calculated derived features (`total_camera` and `total_pixels`) from inputs.
  - Sent user input to the FastAPI backend for prediction via `requests`.

- **Streamlined UI**:
  - Excluded unnecessary fields (`phone_id`, `price_range`) from user input.

---

### **5. Dockerization**
- **Created Dockerfile**:
  - Set up a Docker container to run the FastAPI backend.
  - Included dependencies installation (`requirements.txt`) and proper directory structure.
  - Configured the container to expose port `80` and run the app using `uvicorn`.

---

### **6. Dependency Management**
- **Generated `requirements.txt`**:
  - Included all required Python libraries:
    - `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `xgboost`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `streamlit`, `joblib`, `mlflow`, and more.

---

### **7. Debugging**
- **Fixed Overfitting**:
  - Regularized the `XGBClassifier` with:
    - `max_depth`, `min_child_weight`, and `subsample`.
  - Added early stopping to prevent overfitting during training.

- **Validated Feature Importance**:
  - Found `ram` to dominate, contributing 46% importance.
  - Addressed low-importance features by testing their removal.

- **Ensured Consistency**:
  - Matched preprocessing steps during both training and prediction to avoid data mismatch issues.

---

### **Achievements**
- Successfully trained and deployed an accurate model for predicting mobile price ranges.
- Created a fully integrated system with:
  - **Backend**: FastAPI for predictions.
  - **Frontend**: Streamlit for user interaction.
  - **Docker**: For containerized deployment.
